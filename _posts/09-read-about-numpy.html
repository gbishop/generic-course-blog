<p>Read pages 1-9 and skim the rest of this really nice 
<a href="http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/~shell/che210d/numpy.pdf">Introduction to NumPy and SciPy by Scott Shell</a>. Simply skip the parts you don't understand but refer back to it as we cover more of numpy.</p>

<p>Watch out for an error on page 13, the result of the np.logical_or(b,c) should be 
<pre>
%gt;%gt;%gt; np.logical_or(b,c)
array([ True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)
</pre></p>
