<p>Things to know for the next quiz on Wednesday</p>

<pre>
Assuming these starting conditions:

a = np.arange(1,5) # a vector with 1,2,3,4 as its elements 
b = np.zeros((4,4)) # a 4×4 array of zeros 
c = np.arange(16) # a vector of 16 numbers from 0 through 15 
c.shape = (4,4) # now c is a 4×4 array of numbers 0 through 15

What is the value of each of these expressions?

a.max() 
a.min() 
a.sum() 
a.size 
b[1,:] = a 
b 
c 
c[1:3,1:3] 
b+c 
c.max() 
c.min() 
c.max(0) 
c.sum(0) 
c[2:,2:] = 0 
c[:2,:2] = 1 
c
