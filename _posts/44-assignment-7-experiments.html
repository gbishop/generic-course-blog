<p><b>Due 20 April 2011</b></p>
      <p> 
       In this assignment you will:
      </p> 
      <ol> 
       <li> 
        develop a hypothesis that you can test,
       </li> 
       <li> 
        write a script to collect data,
       </li> 
       <li> 
        collect some data,
       </li> 
       <li> 
        write a script to analyze the data,
       </li> 
       <li> 
        write a short informal presentation of your results.
       </li> 
      </ol> 
      <p> 
       You remember our mantra that scientists use computers to gather data, to analyze data, and to visualize data. In this assignment you'll do all three.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       First you should develop a hypothesis that you can test. To keep things simple and cross platform without requiring you to download more packages, we'll restrict ourselves to experiments in which the subject (you and possibly your friend) types in response to a prompt from the computer. The measured variables will be accuracy and time. For this exercise you are free to develop your own hypothesis though I encourage you to keep it simple because the number of trials required (how much typing you have to do) grows rapidly as the number of degrees of freedom in the experiment rise.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       Example hypotheses could include:
      </p> 
      <ul> 
       <li> 
        Typing home keys is faster than others.
       </li> 
       <li>
       Typing with the right hand is faster for right handed people.
       </li>
       <li>Typing is slower/faster while listening to music.</li>
       <li> 
        The time required to type a response of length N fits an equation of the form A*N + B.
       </li> 
       <li> 
        Typing common digrams (pairs of letters) or trigrams (triplets of letters) is faster than uncommon ones.
       </li> 
       <li> 
        Typing prompts that are slight misspellings of known words is slower than typing correctly spelled words.
       </li> 
       <li> 
        When typing prompts in reverse (i.e. the computer prints dna and you have to type and), the response will be (faster/slower) when the prompt or reversed letters make a common word.
       </li> 
      </ul> 
      <p> 
       You can use one of these or come up with one on your own. I'll be pleased to give you feedback on candidate hypotheses before you try them if you wish. You'll want to randomize your trials to try to minimize the effects of fatigue and training on the results.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       After you come up with a hypothesis you'll need to write a script to collect the data. Your script will print some instructions for the participant and then run a series of trials in which the computer prints a prompt and the subject types a response. You should give the subject some feedback on performance and a short rest every 20 or so trials. Your script should record the data to a file for use in your analysis script. Separating things like this will prevent you from having to rerun the data collection when you are debugging your analysis. Your script should automate all aspects of running the experiment and writing the data to a file.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       Now that you've got some experimental data, you'll write a script to analyze it to see if you can make any claims about the correctness of your hypothesis. Your analysis script will read the data from the file where the experiment script recorded it.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       Finally you'll write a short informal description of your hypothesis, your experimental procedure, and your results. You description should include graphs and simple statistics on the results. If you know, from other courses, about the statistical analysis of experiments (power analysis and such) include that in your discussion but it is not required.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       The description as a PDF file, your scripts, and your data files should put into a zip file and turned into via BlackBoard before midnight on the due date.
      </p> 
      <p> 
       There is no template for this assignment.
