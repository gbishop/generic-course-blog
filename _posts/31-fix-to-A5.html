<p>The version of pylab in the Enthought Python Distribution we are using has a bug in the <code>imsave</code> routine we need. I have modified the prototype in A5.zip to use a different function. If you haven't yet started, download the new version from the assignment. If you have already started modify the function <code>save_binary_image</code> to look like this:</p>
<pre>
def save_binary_image(name, value):
    '''Save a binary image to a file'''
    import scipy
    scipy.misc.imsave(name, value)
</pre>
