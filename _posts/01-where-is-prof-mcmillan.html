title: Where is Prof McMillan?
---
<p>Welcome to Comp 116! I know many of you expected Professor McMillan to be your teacher this semester. Unfortunately, he has been seriously injured and I am here to take his place. He is expected to recover but won't likely be back to teaching until the Fall.</p>

<p>In this course you will learn that scientists use computers to collect, analyze, and display data; and how to do it yourself. My goal is for you to leave the course with tools that will help you in whatever scientific domains you pursue.</p>
