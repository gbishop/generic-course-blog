title: Assignment 2 Download the Software
---
<p>In this assignment you'll download and install the software you need for this course. Don't worry if you don't know how, we'll help in the lab on Friday. But if you all try to download it during class time, our network will melt down. So download it, at least, before class on Friday.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-win-x86.msi">EPD for Windows</a>
     and double-click the resulting installer file. You'll have to tell Windows it's OK to install and accept all the defaults.</li>
    <li>Log out and back in</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811.msi">Komodo-Edit</a>
     and double click the installer. Again, accept all the defaults.</li>
</ol>

<h2>OS X</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-macosx-i386.dmg">EPD for OS X</a>
    . For me, the resulting dmg automatically mounts as a disk. If it doesn't, try double-clicking it. Then run the resulting installer.</li>
    <li>Log out and back in.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-macosx-x86.dmg">Komodo-Edit for OS X</a>
     and install it. Again, accept all the defaults.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-rh5-x86.sh">EPD for Linux</a>
    .</li>
    <li>In a terminal window, cd to the folder where it downloaded and type: <code>./epd-6.3-2-rh5-x86.sh -p /opt</code></li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-linux-libcpp6-x86.tar.gz">Komodo-Edit for Linux</a>
    , unpack the tar file with <code>tar xzf ./Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-linux-libcpp6-x86.tar.gz</code>, cd into the resulting folder, and run the installer with <code>./install.sh</code></li>
</ol>
