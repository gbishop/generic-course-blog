title: Assignment 2 Download the Software
---
<p><b>Due:</b> 14 January 2011 before 11am</p>

<p>In this assignment you'll download and install the software you need for this course. Don't worry if you don't know how, we'll help in the lab on Friday. But if you all try to download it during class time, our network will melt down. So download it, at least, before class on Friday.</p>

<h2>Windows</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-win-x86.msi">EPD for Windows</a> and open the resulting installer file. You'll have to tell Windows it's OK to install and accept all the defaults and the license agreement.</li>
    <li>Log out and back in</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811.msi">Komodo-Edit</a> and open the installer. Again, accept all the defaults.</li>
</ol>

<h2>OS X</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-macosx-i386.dmg">EPD for OS X</a>
    . For me, the resulting dmg automatically mounts as a disk and opens a finder window. Then run the installer by double-clicking <code>EPD.mpkg</code>. Accept all the defaults and agree to the license.</li>
    <li>Log out and back in.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-macosx-x86.dmg">Komodo-Edit for OS X</a>
     and install it by dragging the Komodo Edit icon onto the Applications icon.<li>
    <li>You may this dispose of the files you downloaded by dragging them to the Trash.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Linux</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/epd-6.3-2-rh5-x86.sh">EPD for Linux</a>.</li>
    <li>In a terminal window, cd to the folder where it downloaded and type: <code>./epd-6.3-2-rh5-x86.sh -p /opt/epd/</code>. Accept the defaults and agree to the license.</li>
    <li>Download <a href="http://gb.cs.unc.edu/116/Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-linux-libcpp6-x86.tar.gz">Komodo-Edit for Linux</a>, unpack the tar file with <code>tar xzf ./Komodo-Edit-6.0.3-6811-linux-libcpp6-x86.tar.gz</code>, cd into the resulting folder, and run the installer with <code>./install.sh</code></li>
</ol>
