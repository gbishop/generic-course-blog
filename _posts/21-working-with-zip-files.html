<p>For the remaining assignments you will download a Zip file, unpack it to your desktop, work in that folder, compress the folder (with all its contents) back to a Zip file, and upload that to Blackboard. I'll attempt to describe how that is done for the various systems.</p>

<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>On Windows, the Zip file will appear as a folder with a zipper on it. If you double-click it, you'll get a window that looks lots like an explorer window but the files really aren't yet, accessible to other programs. First you need to click "Extract all files" and tell it where you want them. I find the Desktop convenient but you can put them anywhere you wish.</p>

<p>Now that you have an ordinary folder you can open pylab and cd to the folder. Likewise you can open Komodo-Edit and select Open File, and browse to the folder to choose the prototype python file (e.g. A4.py). Work right in this folder and produce the graphs or images required by the assignment.</p>

<p>When you are finished you'll want to create a Zip file of the folder to turn in. To do that, go to the level where you can see the folder (Desktop for example) and right click on the folder and choose "Send To" and "Compressed (zipped) folder". It will create a Zipped version right there. Now you can upload that to Blackboard.</p>

<h3>OS X</h3>
<p>On OS X, the folder appears to get unzipped by the browser. I recommend putting it on your Desktop where it is easy to find but put it wherever you wish.</p>

<p>Now that you have an ordinary folder you can open pylab and cd to the folder. Likewise you can open Komodo-Edit and select Open File, and browse to the folder to choose the prototype python file (e.g. A4.py). Work right in this folder and produce the graphs or images required by the assignment.</p>

<p>When you are finished you'll want to create a Zip file of the folder to turn in. To do that, go to the level where you can see the folder (Desktop for example) and right click (or Option-Key click) on the folder and choose "Compress folder". It will create a Zipped version right there. Now you can upload that to Blackboard.</p>

<h3>Ubuntu</h3>
<p>On Ubuntu (and most other flavors of Linux) you should be able to double-click on the zip file to open it and extract the files to your Desktop. </p>

<p>Now that you have an ordinary folder you can open pylab and cd to the folder. Likewise you can open Komodo-Edit and select Open File, and browse to the folder to choose the prototype python file (e.g. A4.py). Work right in this folder and produce the graphs or images required by the assignment.</p>

<p>When you are finished you'll want to create a Zip file of the folder to turn in. To do that, go to the level where you can see the folder (Desktop for example) and right click on the folder and choose "Compress...". Select .zip from the pulldown and click Create. Upload the resulting file to Blackboard.</p>
