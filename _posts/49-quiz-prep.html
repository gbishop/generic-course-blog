<p>Practice for this week's quiz and for the final exam.</p>

<p>Write functions to solve at least 3 of the following 5 challenges.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Function <code>twomin(x)</code> should take a vector x of numbers,
find the two smallest, and return them in a list result being careful
to properly handle duplicated items. For example <code>twomin(np.array([1,2,1,3,4])</code> should return <code>[1,1]</code>.</li>
    <li>Function <code>dist(p,Q)</code> that takes a point p represented as a
1×d row vector, and a list of n points Q, represented as an n×d
matrix, and returns an n×1 vector of the distance from point p to each
point q[i,:].</li>
    <li>Function <code>pairdist(p,q)</code> that takes two matrices, say m×d and
n×d, and returns the m×n matrix of distances between all pairs of
rows.</li>
    <li>Function <code>isPrime(n)</code> returns True if the number N is prime, False otherwise.</li>
    <li>Function <code>isPalindrome(s)</code> returns True if the string s is a palindrome (same read left to right as right to left), False otherwise.</li>
</ol>
