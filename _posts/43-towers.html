<p>Today we worked through how to solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. First we wrote some simple functions to handle different numbers of disks.</p>
<pre>
def tower1(From, To, Other):
    print 'Move disk from', From, 'to', To

def tower2(From, To, Other):
    tower1(From, Other, To)
    tower1(From, To, Other)
    tower1(Other, To, From)

def tower3(From, To, Other):
    tower2(From, Other, To)
    tower1(From, To, Other)
    tower2(Other, To, From)
</pre>
<p>We could call this function like this:</p>
<pre>
tower3('Top', 'Right', 'Left')
</pre>

<p>Then we realized we could write one <b>recursive</b> function instead of many very similar functions.</p>
<pre>
def tower(N, From, To, Other):
    if N == 1:
        print 'Move disk from', From, 'to', To
    else:
        tower(N-1, From, Other, To)
        tower(1, From, To, Other)
        tower(N-1, Other, To, From)
</pre>
