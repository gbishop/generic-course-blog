<p><b>Due Monday 31 January by 11:59PM.</b></p>

<p>In this assignment youâ€™ll get to practice with Numpy arrays and calculations in Python.</p>

<p>Download the <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~gb/Comp116Spring2011/files/A3.zip">assignment template</a> and extract it onto your Desktop (or anywhere else that suits you but I'm going to provide directions based on the Desktop). You should see a folder on your desktop named named A3. Open that folder and you should see a file named A3.txt. For this assignment you will edit that file and insert your answers where requested. I suggest you edit the file with Komodo to get used to it but you may use any editor you wish.</p>

<p>Fill in the answers right into the file A3.txt so that your teaching assistants can see both the original question and your answer.</p>

<p>Submit your answer via blackboard.</p>
